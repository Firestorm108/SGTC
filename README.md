# SGTC
A &lt;1kW, highly tuned, resonant, and optimized spark-gap tesla coil. Shoots multiple foot-long sparks!

It is based off a dual-MOT design with one MOT (tied secondary) as the ballast, effectively supplying greater than 1kW of power to the coil.

<h1>What is a spark gap tesla coil?</h1>

Transformers need a switching current to operate. All tesla coils are transformers, and so the primary current must be switched on and off tens or hundreds of thousands of times per second.
This is achieved in any different ways depending on the type of coil.

SSTC (Solid State Tesla Coil) (inc. DRSSTC, HFSSTC, QCW, etc...) - Uses silicon for switching, MOSFET, IGBT, etc. Relatively low voltage on the primary. <br>
VTTC (Vacuum Tube Tesla Coil) (inc. HFVTTC, etc.) - Uses 20th century vacuum tubes for switching, such as a GU81M tube. Relatively high voltage on the primary (~2kVish is normal). Not enough for a proper spark gap, but vacuum tubes can handle the high voltage. <br>
SGTC (Spark Gap Tesla Coil) - Uses a spark gap (triggered by a high voltage breakdown of the air) to switch current on and off. Extremely high voltage on the primary, more than 5kV. <br>
